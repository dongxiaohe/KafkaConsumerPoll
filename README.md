We are using Kafka consumer api `poll` to retrieve topic data. However, we would like to understand more details about `poll`
This repo has some code demo to demonstrate
- The relation between `poll` and `offSet`.
- How many records poll will get from kafka topic.


## :dog: Setup
This project needs Java `8` and Scala `2.12.3`
[Install Java](https://java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml)

```bash
# Install Scala
$ brew install scala
$ brew install sbt

# Compile project
$./sbt.sh clean compile
```
---

## :rabbit: Running
The kafka configuration is configured in TopicProvider.scala

You can use zdi to start kafka. for myself, I installed the kafka locally, so I can easily play around with it. 

Start kafka zoo keeper and server properties.
```bash
$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

```bash
$./sbt.sh run
```

## :cat: The results

1. The default size of poll is maximum 500 records. which can be found in doc ([Link](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade_1010_notable))
2. If we poll 500 records but only commit 1 record offset (Which simulates partial transaction), the current consumer ignore offset and continues to poll from 501 records. (See the output above) 
3. If we have long processing time for each poll which takes longer than session timeout time, Kafka will re-balance the consumer group. 
The interesting fact is, this long-time processing consumer will not be terminated but also resume to process again later on.
